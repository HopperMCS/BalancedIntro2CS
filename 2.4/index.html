          <h2>TL;DR</h2><hr>
          <p>I'm a programmer doing an old hobby that started in the third grade!!</p><br>
          
          <hr><h2>Unimportant Details About Myself</h2><hr>
             <h3>Timeline of Birth & Tech</h3>
                <p>I was born in 1998. I started working with computers before kindergarten, and got into plenty of trouble with them.</p>
          
             <h3>Pets I've Had Growing Up</h3>
                <p>I have had two birds (Seven and Floyd), four dogs (Dexter, Oliver, Ruby, and Chase) and one cat (Pumpkin).</p>
                
             <h3>Place of Birth</h3>   
                <p>I was born at St. Rita's Medical Center on July 5th. I have a sister named Kellie.</p>

          <p>As far as hobbies go, I've been doing web design probably the longest. Although I've moved away from it over the<br>
             course of the past few years, old habits die hard I guess. I still find myself obsessively formatting Markdown on <br>
             GitHub, and working on a WordPress theme named <b><i><big><span style="color: orange">Newsprint.</span></big></i></b></p>

          <p>While Newsprint is a slowly progressing project, it's intentionally slow. I don't want to add new features quickly, but instead<br>
             develop them over time. Yes, it's PHP (which I actually learned in place of where JavaScript SHOULD be for most of you guys).<br>
             Other hobbies? Occasionally reading, and I also used to be involved in gardening. That was back before we moved to a house<br>
             who's yard couldn't handle it.</p>

      <div style="text-align: center">
          <p>I don't play favorites with books. However, my favorite movie is <i>The Internship</i>, and my favorite TV show/series is the now<br>
             discontinued <i>Futurama</i>.</p>
