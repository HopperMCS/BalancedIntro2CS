      <p>I'm a programmer doing an old hobby that started in the third grade!!</p>
      
      <p>I was born in 1998. I started working with computers before kindergarten, and got into plenty of trouble with them.<br>
         I have had two birds (Seven and Floyd), four dogs (Dexter, Oliver, Ruby, and Chase) and one cat (Pumpkin).<br> 
         I was born at St. Rita's Medical Center on July 5th. I have a sister named Kellie.</p>      
         
      <p>As far as hobbies go, I've been doing web design probably the longest. Although I've moved away from it over the<br>
         course of the past few years, old habits die hard I guess. I still find myself obsessively formatting Markdown on <br>
         GitHub, and working on a WordPress theme named Newsprint.</p>
         
      <p>While Newsprint is a slowly progressing project, it's intentionally slow. I don't want to add new features quickly, but instead<br>
         develop them over time. Yes, it's PHP (which I actually learned in place of where JavaScript SHOULD be for most of you guys).<br>
         Other hobbies? Occasionally reading, and I also used to be involved in gardening. That was back before we moved to a house<br>
         who's yard couldn't handle it.</p>

      <p>I don't play favorites with books. However, my favorite movie is The Internship, and my favorite TV show/series is the now<br>
         discontinued Futurama.</p>
