The "depth" chapters are all located here, by exercise number

## Reasons Why You May Have Ended Up Here
**1.** #StalkMeOnGitHub (former joke used on other social media)

**2.** This is a repo I told you about when the time came to. So, you either googled *m gage morgan* or knew my GitHub domain. I only focuse on the *non-breadth chapters*. I could care less how Intel or AMD manufacture their processors, and I could care less how NVIDIA manufactures its GTX GPUs. In the end, all those details end up abstracted away from the programmer, and it's no longer a concern.

That said, likely you want to see just how far I got. I will copy files to respective folders for exercises that build on previous ones if/when applicable. This is not to be shared among students, because it could lead to cheating (JavaScript, I'm looking at you). I helped some students at EHS navigate through Codecademy's HTML/CSS courses, but Mark Suter didn't get far enough into it (I usually end up using Bootstrap for modeling, then CSS all IDs and classes when I'm done modeling - not a firm believer in all websites need to look the same). As for me, I never ended up utilizing the half of Codecademy outside of screwing off during downtime.

## Intents and Purposes
**VCS** - You need to learn to use one. Web developer, systems software developer, engineer, doesn't matter. Tools like Git are used for a specific reason. This way, you can see where you started from ground zero if you screw something up. 

I'm putting this on Git as a way to track my progress and a way for me to backup this stuff so when something happens I don't lose everything.

## Chapter 2 Completion
You may have noticed some missing exercises. This is because the ones I skipped were not relevant to the task at hand. For example, I decided to use a light blue background for the page instead of using an image. Also, I didn't do the one requiring Flash, for obvious reasons (#GetHacked to those of you that still use Flash).
